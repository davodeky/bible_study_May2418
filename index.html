	     <h1>Transfiguration of Christ</h1>
	  </p>
		 <h4>This Week's Scriptures</h4>
		 <ul>
		   <li><a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+17%3A1-13&version=NKJV"> Matthew 17: 1-13 </a> </li>
		 </ul>
		 <h4>Sunday Sermon Pointers</h4>
		 <div class="container">
		 <div class = "col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
		 <ul>
		   <li>The high mountain was one of spiritual dimension.</li>
		   <li>The transfiguration experience was a preparation to the disciples for what was yet to come- the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</li>
		   <li>We go to the Mountain-top for the annointing to be able to fight in the valleys.</li>
		   <li>When we got the mountain we never come back the same.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <h4>Discussion Question</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li>Why did Jesus Christ take the disciples through the mountain-top experience- His transfiguration?</li>
		 </ul>
		 <h5>Context</h5>
		 <ul>
		 <li>The confusion of who Jesus was (Matthew 16).</li>
		 </ul>
		 <h5>Meaning</h5>
		 <ul>
		 <li>A lesson for the disciples about who Jesus was </li>
		 <li>This scene demanded that men hear Jesus as one who had authority to speak to them (<a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A16-21&version=NIV">2 Peter 1:16-21</a>)</li>
		 <li>The transfiguration confirmed that the kingdom of the Messiah would be characterized by glory.</li>
		 <li>This scene is the key to understanding the cross of Jesus and his commitment to it (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A30-31&version=NKJV">Luke 9:30-31</a>)</li>

		 <h4>Core Point</h4>
		 <ul>
		   <li>Jesus Christ wanted his disciples to know that He would, indeed, be glorified, but it would not at all be the kind of glory most people were expecting (a worldly kind of supremacy)</li>
